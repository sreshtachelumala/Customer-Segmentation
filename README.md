# Mall Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## Project Description
This project aims to segment customers using the Mall Customers dataset based on their spending habits, annual income, age, and other demographic features. The K-Means clustering algorithm is used to group customers into clusters, and various visualizations are created to better understand the behavior and patterns of different customer segments.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Explore and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize demographic data (age, gender, annual income, and spending score) using histograms, bar plots, and pie charts.
- **Clustering**: Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Visualize clustering results using PCA and evaluate the number of optimal clusters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use Silhouette scores and Gap statistics to assess cluster quality.

## Technologies Used
- **R Programming**
- **Libraries**:
  - `ggplot2` for data visualization
  - `plotrix` for pie charts
  - `cluster` and `factoextra` for clustering and visualizing results
  - `NbClust` for optimal cluster evaluation
  - `purrr` for functional programming utilities
 
## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sreshtachelumala/mall-customer-segmentation.git
 
## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to segmenting customers based on their attributes, helping businesses identify distinct customer groups and design targeted strategies for each segment.
